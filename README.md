# Multisig Wallet Smart Contract

## Overview

This project is a multisig wallet smart contract implemented in Solidity. The wallet allows multiple owners to approve transactions, ensuring enhanced security. Additionally, it includes a feature that locks the transaction amount in the wallet until a specific number of owners approve the transaction within a predefined time frame.

## Features

- **Multisig Approval**: Multiple owners can approve transactions, ensuring that no single owner can execute a transaction unilaterally.
- **Locked Amount**: Transaction amounts are locked in the wallet until the required number of owners approve the transaction within a specified time.
- **Security**: Enhanced security through multisig approval and locked amounts.
